# Silicon Copéllia
Silicon Copéllia is a software for making robots response affactively to other agents.
This project aims to cope with the number produced by Copéllia during the affection/emotion processing process and make Copéllia talks by applying NLP.

# Installation
The project is still in its development phase. Source code and README files will be updated periodically

# To-Do
- [x] The first tasks will be **mapping the numbers to a pool of fix sentances**
- [x]  ~~Audio sound to read out the output string(TTS)~~  
       We only provide [mac usage now](https://github.com/BanjiBear/Copellia)
- [x]  Implement version 2 with new model and detailed reasoning between the input features and the output sentence
- [x]  CHEN Yi pu: Modify the abstract class, Use Intention, and the main function
